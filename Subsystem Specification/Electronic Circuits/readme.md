In this part, we are looking at what sensors we are using.

The sensors we are going to use are:

1) Ultrasonic sensor (to locate object)
2) Light sensor (to locate obstacles, to follow the signals given off)
3) Audio sensor (to locate obstacles, to follow the signals given off)
4) Motion sensor (to locate human; to find where the victim is)
5) Touch sensor (for victim to interact with the rescue robot)
