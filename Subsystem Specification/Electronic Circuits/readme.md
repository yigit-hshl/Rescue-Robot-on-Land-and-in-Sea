# Circuit Elements

In this part, we will look at what sensors we are going to use for our rescue robot.

The sensors we are using are:

**1) Ultrasonic sensor**
- to locate object/obstacle

**2) Light sensor**
- to locate obstacles
- to follow the signals given off
- to retrieve distress signals from the victim

**3) Audio sensor**
- to locate obstacles
- to follow the signals given off
- to retrieve distress signals from the victim

**4) Motion sensor**
- to locate human; to find where the victim is

**5) Touch sensor**
- for victim to interact with the rescue robot

# Circuit Board
We are using **Arduino UNO R3** for the circuit board.

*Why Arduino?*
It is easy and convenient to use - familiar from last semester's Microcontroller project.

# Software used
For designing the circuit elements, we used Fritzing and Tinkercad (https://www.tinkercad.com/).
