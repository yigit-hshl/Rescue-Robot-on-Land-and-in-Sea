# Circuit Elements

In this part, we will look at what sensors we are going to use for our rescue robot.

The sensors we are using are:

1) Ultrasonic sensor (to locate object)
2) Light sensor (to locate obstacles, to follow the signals given off)
3) Audio sensor (to locate obstacles, to follow the signals given off)
4) Motion sensor (to locate human; to find where the victim is)
5) Touch sensor (for victim to interact with the rescue robot)

# Circuit Board
We are using Arduino UNO R3 for the circuit board.
