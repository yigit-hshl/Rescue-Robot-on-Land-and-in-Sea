# Design

Please refer to the folders for the final submission files!

Here we will look at the design of our rescue robot.

**1) Specification**

To complete the first exploratory phase, list the requirements for
your design in a simple list.
- Consider aspects like ergonomics and interaction, production,
assembly, transport, use, maintenance, recycling, costs, time
management (Pahl/Beitz)
- Define which requirements are fixed (must have), minimal (to
have more or less) or desirable (nice to have).

**2) Conceptional model**

The conceptual model is created based on Don Norman's theory.

**3) Model ratio**

The rescue robot's model ratio is based on 

**4) 3D Parts**

3D parts, including assembly file, are added with screenshots.
