# Design

Here we will look at the design of our rescue robot.

**1) Specification**

To complete the first exploratory phase, list the requirements for
your design in a simple list.
- Consider aspects like ergonomics and interaction, production,
assembly, transport, use, maintenance, recycling, costs, time
management (Pahl/Beitz)
- Define which requirements are fixed (must have), minimal (to
have more or less) or desirable (nice to have).
