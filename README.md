# Wakanda Foreva

Hello everyone :)

The final submission files are available in the respective folders (labelled accordingly with "final" tags).

For this project,

1) Please refer to specific repositories for your interest. Every repository has a readme.md to help you understand what it is for!

2) All related files are added to GitHub. Project schedulings are all discussed in Trello. Please reach out to Heansuh Lee via email: heansuh@gmail.com. He will provide the Trello share link.

Anyone can edit this README.md file until the end of the final project.

Thank you!
